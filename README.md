play YouTube with user's speech!

When you run this python script with command python3 main.py it's always run with while true loop until have an error.
When this python script is working when you call "benjamin" (name of this service that i named him) then python script will say "Hi what song" to you
you just say some music that you want to listen this python script will open music on youtube with default web browser program.

this is NOT involve with any machine learning technique. It just sample code to play music with youtube by convert your speech to text and search in youtube with view count filter and play it!

DISADVANTAGE of this script : when you in environment with a lot of noise this doesn't work well and it can convert only english language.

in my code you must install some extra library.
